# A Humble Lua Constraint Solver
This is my first project in Lua so there are probably some blunder with respect to Lua principles.

The n-queens constraint satisfaction problem is provided as an example. The solver makes use of 2-way branching, dynamic variable ordering (smallest domain first), and dynamic domain value ordering (least constraining first). 

Implemented using Lua 5.3.2
